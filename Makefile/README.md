Practice of make command:
1. create a simple Makefile that includes a target named hello which, when executed, prints "Hello,Make!" to the console.
2. Define a variable CC for the compiler and another variable CFLAGS for compiler flags in a Makefile. Use these variables to compile a C program with a source file named app.c into an executable named my_app.
3. Create a Makefile for a project with two C source files:main.c and helper.c. Include a target all that compiles both source files into an executable named my_program.
4. Modify the previous Makefile to include a header file named helper.h. Ensure that changes to helper.h trigger recompilation to helper.c and main.c.
